1. "video_analysis": A detailed 3-5 sentence play-by-play of what happens in the video.
   Describe the actions, reactions, and key moments chronologically.

2. "scene_prompt": A single sentence describing the main action for animation purposes,
   written as if {char.visual_short}, a character named {n}, is performing it.
   Write it as a camera direction, e.g. "{n} slips on wet floor, arms flailing wildly,
   arms flailing wildly as bystanders gasp".
   Focus on the most dramatic/funny moment. Describe what literally happens — do NOT
   invent a comedic spin; the Creative Director decides the angle downstream.
   Keep it under 50 words. Always refer to the character as "{n}".

3. "character_outfit": A detailed description of what the main person in the video is wearing.
   Include: type of clothing (dress, suit, jersey, t-shirt, uniform, etc.), colors, patterns,
   accessories (hat, sunglasses, jewelry, scarf), and any distinctive features. Be specific
   enough that an artist could recreate the outfit on a different character.
   Example: "Navy blue slim-fit suit with white dress shirt, red striped tie, silver watch"
   or "Bright red sequined gown with thin spaghetti straps, diamond drop earrings".

4. "character_gender": The gender of the main person — either "male" or "female".
   If unclear, default to "male".

5. "num_people": The number of people visible in the video (integer).

6. "video_keywords": Listen to the audio. Pick up to 5 standout spoken words or short phrases
   that would be funny if the character randomly yelled them out of context.
   Prefer punchy, emotional, or absurd-sounding words (e.g. "happy", "silver", "incredible",
   "oh no", "let's go"). Return as a JSON array of strings. If there is no clear speech,
   return an empty array [].

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation. Do not put real newlines inside JSON string values — use \\n for line breaks. Keep each field value as a single line."""
